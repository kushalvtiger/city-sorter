### Instructions

<ul>
<li>Run "mvn clean install" for command runs. Assuming mvn is installed and if not I can push the jar to take in arguments to be ran with JVM.</li> 
<li>Open in any IDE to run a Junit.</li> 
<li>I was not sure weather the output must be written to a csv file or just print, currently I am printing everything on console.</li> 
<li>Outputting to a file will not be a big change. and we can use the existing API with columnName as file names for different outputs.</li>  
<li>Also I have tested main combination of happy paths and not failure cases. I can go ahead and update the tests and code as needed.</li> 
</ul>

Let me know if any additional improvements are required. 

### TODOs
1) Update Unit Tests <br>
2) Update Workflow Tests<br>
3) Write output to CSV Files<br>
4) Convert this to an executable or deployable jar that can be shipped<br>
5) Allow user interaction though console/UI. <br>

Based on the intent and scope we can improvise.
