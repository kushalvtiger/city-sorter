Run "mvn clean install" for command runs. 
Open in any IDE to run a Junit. 

I was no sure of weather the output must be written to a csv file or just print. Currently I am printing everything and outputting to a file will not be a big change. 
Also I have tested main combination of happy paths and not failure cases. 
I can go ahead and update the tests and code as needed. 

Let me know if any additional improvements are required. 

TODOs
1) Update Unit Tests
2) Update Workflow Tests
3) Write output to CSV Files
4) Convert this to an executable or deployable jar that can be shipped
5) Allow user interaction though console/UI. 

Based on the intent and scope we can improvise. I just dint want to spend time if not necessary.
